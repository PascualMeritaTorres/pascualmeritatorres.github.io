This blogpost is essentially a partial collection of all the interesting blogs or posts that I have been reading lately. It intends to span all aspects of life, from academic to personal, just really anything that I think may be useful to myself or anyone reading. Also, if you like any of the linked posts, I really recommend reading other pieces from the authors, as most of the time that´s how I discover these posts in the first place.

## AI-related

#### Classics

- Richard Sutton´s [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). My biggest takeaway from it is that
  > "building how we think we think does not work in the long run"

#### Non-Classics (Yet)?

- Tim Rocktäschel´s [Advice for Short-term Machine Learning Research Projects](https://rockt.github.io/2018/08/29/msc-advice)
- Evan Miller´s [Attention is Off By One](https://www.evanmiller.org/attention-is-off-by-one.html)

## Personal Life

- Andrej Karpathy´s [A Survival Guide to a PhD](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/), which in my opinion is completely generalisable to doing research in general, not only during a PhD. In fact, I think some of his thoughts (such as developing taste) are applicable to working in almost any job in general.

- Spruce Campbell's [Don´t Ask Successful People for Advice](https://spruce.world/blog/dont-ask-successful-people-for-advice.html), instead ask for criticism.

  > (If you ask for criticism, ) what they say to you is probably going to be much more actionable, direct and sensible than if you asked for generic advice.

- Spruce Campbell's [Talking to Geniuses](https://spruce.world/blog/talking-to-geniuses.html)

- Paul Graham´s [The Right Kind of Stubborn](https://www.paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f1n)
  > The persistent (good kind of stubborn) are attached to the goal. The obstinate (bad kind of stubborn) are attached to their ideas about how to reach it.
