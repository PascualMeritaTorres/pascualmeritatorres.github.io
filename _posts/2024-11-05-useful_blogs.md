There are many influential (and not so influential) people that have spent a lot of time writing their learning and thoughts down. More often than not they come in the form of blogposts. This is an incomplete collection of the ones that I have been reading since September 2024. Hope they are useful!

## AI-related

#### Classics

- Richard Sutton's [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). My biggest takeaway from it is that

  > "building how we think we think does not work in the long run"

- Andrej Karpathy's [A Survival Guide to a PhD](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/), which in my opinion is completely generalisable to doing research in general, not only during a PhD. In fact, I think some of his thoughts (such as developing taste) are applicable to working in almost any job in general.

#### Non-Classics (Yet)?

- Tim Rocktäschel's [Advice for Short-term Machine Learning Research Projects](https://rockt.github.io/2018/08/29/msc-advice)

- Evan Miller´s [Attention is Off By One](https://www.evanmiller.org/attention-is-off-by-one.html)

- Sebastian Ruder's [10 Tips for Research and a PhD](https://www.ruder.io/10-tips-for-research-and-a-phd/#1-read-broadly-)

- Jason Eisner's [Write the Paper First](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html?ref=ruder.io)

  > There are 2 reasons a paper will be cited. 1) If you have a great implementation that people can just use as a black box. 2) Otherwrise, your paper is only useful for the ideas that it provides.

- Jason Eisner's [How to Read a Paper](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-read-a-paper.html)

## Personal Life

- Spruce Campbell's [Don´t Ask Successful People for Advice](https://spruce.world/blog/dont-ask-successful-people-for-advice.html), instead ask for criticism.

  > (If you ask for criticism, ) what they say to you is probably going to be much more actionable, direct and sensible than if you asked for generic advice.

- Spruce Campbell's [Talking to Geniuses](https://spruce.world/blog/talking-to-geniuses.html)

- Paul Graham's [The Right Kind of Stubborn](https://www.paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f1n)
  > The persistent (good kind of stubborn) are attached to the goal. The obstinate (bad kind of stubborn) are attached to their ideas about how to reach it.
