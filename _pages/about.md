I'm currently an AI Research Engineer at Huawei, where I focus on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) under the supervision of [Pavlos Vougiouklis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9J7YeR0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Jeff Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zLDAY8QAAAAJ&hl=es). If you're interested in learning a bit more about me, please take a look at some of [my blog posts](https://pascualmeritatorres.github.io/blog/). Here are some of my thoughts about the future of AI: 

-The path toward artificial super-intelligence will likely emerge from pre-trained foundation models (trained on next token prediction) that <u>continually</u> learn through interactions with their environment. This continuous learning process will likely involve continual reinforcement learning.

-As the capabilities of these self-improving systems advance, the final question we must ultimately resolve is: "What should they optimise for?"

Prior to joining Huawei, I earned my Master's degree in AI from The University of Edinburgh. My research there focused on improving the efficiency of Vision Transformers through token pooling techniques, achieving up to 1.4x faster inference times while maintaining comparable accuracy. This work was conducted under the guidance of [Edoardo Ponti](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=tklL2q0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Piotr Nawrot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9wrNHUQAAAAJ&hl=en). During my time in Edinburgh, I also co-founded and was president of [Edinburgh AI](https://edinburghai.org/), the university's AI society. With now over 400 members, talks by the likes of DeepMind, and a yearly conference where students can present their work, it has grown into a thriving community that I am proud to have started.

Before that, I earned a BSc in Computer Science from King's College London. My thesis focused on 'Similarity-based Music Recommendation Systems', where I employed various CNNs to recommend songs similar to a given input. My official supervisor was [Jeroen Keppens](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=6uEtmfoAAAAJ&hl=de), while I also received valuable guidance from my unofficial advisors, [Timothy Greer (Amazon Music)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-greer-ph-d-28630671/) and [Minz Won (Suno AI)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x5rArQMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Overall, I would say I am driven by two different kinds of projects: One kind consists of projects that have a significant, tangible impact on other people's lives. The other kind are those which pose questions that motivate me from a philosophical perspective. I am happiest when I can work on a project that ticks both boxes.
